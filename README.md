# coding-quiz
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the statr button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score



make html and css
make start button
start a timer when start is clicked
hide start button
show questions on start button
rotate through questions once an answer is clicked 
timer -5sec if answer = false if statement
 game end on timer 0 or all questions finished
 scoreboard at end
